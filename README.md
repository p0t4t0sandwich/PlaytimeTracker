# PlaytimeTracker

## What does it do?
This is a Bungeecord plugin I've designed to hook into a MySQL database to track player playtime across all my servers, with the ability to add new columns as needed.

## Where am I going with this?
The main plan is to update and improve the plugin as I learn more of the spigot/bungee APIs and as my backend infastructure develops.

## How do you get this plugin running?
There is currently no config, so you'll need to edit the DataSource class file to add in your database information, then compile the Jar using maven.
